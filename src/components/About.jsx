        I'm Sudhanshu Kumar, a final-year undergraduate in 
        Material Science and Engineering at IIT Kanpur. My diverse 
        interests have driven me to explore a wide range of fields, from 
        Machine Learning, NLP, and Deep Learning to Iron and Steel Making,
        CAD, and Advanced Computational Techniques. I bring a unique blend of 
        these cutting-edge skills, seamlessly integrating them with my core 
        expertise in Material Science.

        During my internship at KnowledgeEdgeAI, I developed a YouTube Video-Based Question Answering System, 
        utilizing advanced AI/ML techniques. My hands-on projects range from obstacle avoidance using CNNs to 
        building a Transformer architecture from scratch and synthesizing zinc-doped hydroxyapatite nanoparticles 
        for biomedical applications<br/> <br/>
        I've taken on significant leadership roles, notably as a Senior Executive at Techkritiâ€™23, 
        where I led large teams and successfully organized major events. My technical expertise 
        spans programming in C++ and Python, along with web development using ReactJs. Through 
        various projects with the Aeromodelling Club, I've also refined my skills in CAD design, 
        structural analysis with ANSYS, and more.
